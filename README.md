The aim of this study is to monitor the traffic on a network and train the received data with a hybrid artificial intelligence model to classify the files or requests flowing in the traffic into 2 categories as harmful and non-harmful. If we talk about the data set 
second column : A specific time stamp or duration. Indicates the time period during which traffic data was collected.

src column : Source address or source node. The device or IP address that sent the packet.

dst column : Destination address or destination node. Device or IP address receiving the packet.

packetcount column : The number of packets sent in a given period of time.

src_ratio column : The ratio of packets belonging to the source address to total packets.

dst_ratio column: Ratio of packets belonging to destination address to total packets.

src_duration_ratio column: The duration ratio of packets belonging to the source address.

dst_duration_ratio column: Duration ratio of packets belonging to destination address.

TotalPacketDuration column: Total duration of all packets.

TotalPacketLenght column: Total length of all packets.

src_packet_ratio column: The ratio of packets from the source address.

dst_packet_ratio column: The ratio of packets going to the destination address.

DioCount column: Number of DIO (DODAG Information Object) messages. IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol.

DisCount column: Number of DIS (DODAG Information Solicitation) messages. It belongs to the RPL protocol.

DaoCount column: Number of DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) messages. It belongs to the RPL protocol.
